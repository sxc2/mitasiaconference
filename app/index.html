                        <p>The global economy is finally recovering. The increased connectivity through new technologies have led to changing consumer behavior and transformed business practices across markets, economies and industries. The value creation in businesses has fundamentally shifted from efficient production on goods and services to greater shareholders’ return, and now with an emphasis on creativity and society. The expanding middle class in Asia has led to a tremendous rise in living standards of people whilst become a big challenge to the global environment. The disruption of natural disaster has also put more risks to society.
                        </p>
                        <p>With these dynamics and uncertainties, what would keep the momentum of growth and drive changes in the region? Can Asia remain the engine of growth for the world’s economy? MIT Sloan Asia Business Conference 2014 will explore regional innovation, identify challenges and deliberate business opportunities facing Asia in the coming year.
